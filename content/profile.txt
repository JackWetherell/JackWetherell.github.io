             I am data scientist and researcher specializing in machine learning and theoretical physics.

             At <a href="https://humn.ai/">Humn.ai</a> I am using machine learning for the creation of predictive models of risk in real-time for the platformâ€™s
             context-aware, real-time behavioural pricing and risk engine, with a focus on application to autonomous vehicles.

             Prior to my current role, I completed an 18 month research contract at the <a href="https://www.polytechnique.edu/en">Ecole Polytechnique</a> in Paris. My re-
             search was focused on the development and integration of modern machine learning and theoretical techniques
             for the development of cutting edge quantum technology, such as real-time prediction of molecular electronics.

             I am also the lead developer of the <a href="http://www-users.york.ac.uk/~rwg3/idea.html">iDEA code</a>, which is an international collaborative quantum mechanics simu-
             lation package written in Python and C.

          <p>
             I am an associate member of the <a href="https://www.iop.org/">Institute of Physics</a> (IOP), a member of the
             <a href = "http://www.etsf.eu/">European Theoretical Spectroscopy Facility</a> (ETSF) and the
             <a href = "https://www.york.ac.uk/physics/ycqt/">York Centre for Quantum Technologies</a> (YCQT).
