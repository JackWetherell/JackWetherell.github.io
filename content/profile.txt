		I am a research scientist and theoretical physicist currently working at the <a href="https://www.polytechnique.edu/en">École Polytechnique</a> in Palaiseau, in the group of <a href="https://etsf.polytechnique.fr">Lucia Reining</a>.
                My broad research aim is
		to develop improved models of electron interaction, that can be applied to systems at
		the forefront of quantum technology, such as molecular junctions. More specifically, I
		use exactly-solvable model systems to develop new approximations within many-body
		perturbation theory and time-dependent density functional theory. I work to integrate
		modern deep learning methodologies into cutting edge theoretical descriptions of
		matter. I am also a lead developer of the <a href="http://www-users.york.ac.uk/~rwg3/idea.html">iDEA code</a>.
