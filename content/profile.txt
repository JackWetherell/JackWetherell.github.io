             I am a research scientist at the <a href="https://www.polytechnique.edu/en">École Polytechnique</a> in Palaiseau, in the group of
             <a href="https://etsf.polytechnique.fr">Lucia Reining</a>, specialising in quantum chemistry, theoretical physics and machine learning.
             My broad research aim is to develop improved models of electron interaction, that can be applied to systems at the cutting-edge of
             quantum technology, such as molecular junctions. More specifically, I use exacly-solvable model systems to develop new approximations
             within many-body perturbation theory and time-dependent density functional theory, integrating these approaches with modern machine learning methods.
             I am also one of the lead developers of the <a href="http://www-users.york.ac.uk/~rwg3/idea.html">iDEA code</a>.
