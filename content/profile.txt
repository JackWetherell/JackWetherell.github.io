I am a research scientist in the fields of imagineering, autonomous vehicles, and quantum technologies, specializing in machine learning, computer vision, simulation, and data science.
<br><br>
I currently work as a postdoctoral research associate with Disney Research at Walt Disney Imagineering in Los Angeles, where I work on AI research.
<br><br>
Prior to my current role, in the autonomous vehicle (AV) modeling and simulation team within data science at Humn, I used machine learning for the creation of predictive models of AV risk for the platform's context-aware, real-time behavioral and environmental risk engine.  I deployed many types of automated driving systems in state-of-the-art simulators in a range of diverse scenarios, in order to create machine-learned models of the vehicle-environment interaction. 
<br><br>
Previously, I completed a postdoctoral research contract at the Ecole Polytechnique in Paris. My research was focused on the development and integration of modern machine learning and theoretical techniques for the development of cutting edge quantum technology, in particular, the real-time prediction of molecular electronics. This work followed on from my PhD research at the York Center of Quantum Technologies. 
<br><br>
I am also the lead developer of the <a href="http://www-users.york.ac.uk/~rwg3/idea.html">iDEA code</a>, which is an a free software framework in python for experiments, testing and education in many-body quantum physics with a focus on reputability, interactivity and simplicity.
<p>
I am an associate member of the <a href="https://www.iop.org/">Institute of Physics</a> (IOP), a member of the
<a href = "http://www.etsf.eu/">European Theoretical Spectroscopy Facility</a> (ETSF) and the
<a href = "https://www.york.ac.uk/physics/ycqt/">York Centre for Quantum Technologies</a> (YCQT).
