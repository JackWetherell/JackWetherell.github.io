I am scientific researcher and data scientist specializing in machine learning, autonomous vehicles and data-driven modelling, with a background in theoretical physics.
<br>
I currently head-up the autonomous vehicle modelling and simulation team within data science at <a href="https://humn.ai/">Humn</a>, where I am using machine learning for the creation of predictive models 
of autonomous vehicle (AV) risk in real-time for the platform's context-aware, real-time behavioural risk and safety engine.  I deploy many types of real-world automated driving 
systems in state-of-the-art simulators in a range of diverse scenarios, in order to create machine-learned models of the vehicles. These models are built using industry-leading 
technologies and frameworks. We also work closely with the University of Salford AV lab, making use of the self-driving technology and simulation facilities.
<br>
Prior to my current role, I completed an 18 month research contract at the <a href="https://www.polytechnique.edu/en">Ecole Polytechnique</a> in Paris. My research 
was focused on the development and integration of modern machine learning and theoretical techniques for the development of cutting edge quantum technology, such 
as real-time prediction of molecular electronics.
   <br>
             I am also the lead developer of the <a href="http://www-users.york.ac.uk/~rwg3/idea.html">iDEA code</a>, which is an international collaborative 
             quantum mechanics simulation package written in Python and C.
          <p>
             I am an associate member of the <a href="https://www.iop.org/">Institute of Physics</a> (IOP), a member of the
             <a href = "http://www.etsf.eu/">European Theoretical Spectroscopy Facility</a> (ETSF) and the
             <a href = "https://www.york.ac.uk/physics/ycqt/">York Centre for Quantum Technologies</a> (YCQT).
