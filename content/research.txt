          <b>Autonomous Vehicles</b><br>
          I currently work as a machine learning data scientist at Humn AI. My role is to develop machine learning models to quantify and predict the environmental and 
          behavioral risks generated by fleets of autonomous vehicles. I deploy many types of real-world automated driving systems in state-of-the-art simulators in a 
          range of diverse scenarios, in order to generate risk profiles of the vehicles, and learn how these couple to the environmental effects. This allows me to 
          train machine learning models that can couple the environmental features of a vehicle to its driving events that produce risk, unique to self-driving systems. 
          These models are built using industry-leading technologies and frameworks. Producing these machine-learned models of autonomous vehicle risk has allowed me to 
          deepen my experience in the implementation of deep learning and classical machine learning methods, using TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, Cuda, and sklearn. 
          In addition, due to the large scale nature of the data, I have applied many machine learning training, versioning, management and deployment tools such 
          as ML Flow, CI, AWS (EC2 deployment and s3 hosting), git, DVC, and GPU model deployment.

          In addition, I have worked to develop HumnPilot, our custom-built self-driving car software system. This allows me to fully understand the self-driving 
          software stack as I have implemented them directly in C++ and python. More specifically, this allows our team to have total control over the behavior of
          the driving system and allows us to determine which components of the system are responsible for particular risks. I also entered the Waymo motion prediction 
          competition, where the goal was to develop a deep learning model that could predict the motion of real vehicles from sensor data, using the extensive Waymo open 
          dataset. I developed a custom rasterization-based convolutional neural network (CNN) method that considered time as a channel of a high-dimensional image. 
          My method came in 13th place at the end of the competition, out of several hundred entrants. Training this model on a huge dataset (~5TB compressed) on a 
          V100 GPU allowed me to gain invaluable experience in optimizing machine learning pipelines, ensuring no bottlenecks are present, and maximizing GPU utilization.
          <br><br>
          I also have taken part and completed the Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree. In this six-month intensive distance learning program, led by world 
          experts in the field such as Sebastian Thrun (the creator of the DARPA Grand Challenge winner Stanley), and Vincent Vanhoucke (the principal scientist at Google Brain), 
          I learned how to write the computer vision and machine learning code required to program a self-driving car. In this project-based nanodegree, I learned more advanced 
          concepts in computer vision, object recognition, filtering, deep learning, convolutional and fully convolutional neural networks, behavioral cloning, sensor fusion, 
          and how to integrate these methods with robotics systems using ROS (robot operating system).
          <br><br>
          I also am responsible for training new members of the data science team on the topics of machine learning and computational skills related to our research projects 
          involving autonomous vehicles. I give regular pedological talks on our machine learning methods and autonomous vehicle research to both technical and non technical 
          members of the wider company and to external collaborators.

          <b>Quantum Technologies</b><br>
          Many of my current projects involve integrating modern machine learning approaches, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to inform the development of new methods in condensed
          matter physics. Our general aim is to train machine learning models to learn the fundamental properties of important but difficult to approximate quantities such as the single-particle
          reduced density matrix, and thus we can gain insight at a deep level, to what features are the most crucial and how we can describe them in a way that is the most amenable to approximation.
	  We have recently completed work into building functionals and gaining insights into the single-particle reduced density matrix using deep learning [<a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2020/fd/d0fd00061b#!divAbstract">J.

          I also organsied the 2021 GDR REST Machine Learning Discussion Meeting in Palaiseau, and my introductory talk on the basics of machine learning can be found on YouTube:

          <i>Many-Body Perturbation Theory</i><br>
	  One of my main branches of research involve investigating existing, and developing novel, corrections to methods within Many-Body Perturbation Theory (MBPT). MBPT is
          an intuitive theory that describes how a system responds when electrons are added and removed, with central concepts of the many-body Green's function and screened interaction.
          To date we are investigating the effect of the many flavors of the GW approximation on the electron density, associated Kohn-Sham potentials and quasi-particle energies by
          comparing to the exact quantities. <img src="files/ssc.png" alt="Self Screening Correction" style="width:280px;border:5px solid white;float:right;"> We are currenty using this to develop models of
	  the electron screening that capture the correct behavior of the most well-performing GW flavors, without
          the onerous computation cost they entail. Thus far we have developed a novel vertex correction to the self-energy within a GW calculation that eliminates the unwanted effect of the
          well-known self-screening error with a very small additional computational cost [<a href="https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.97.121102">J. Wetherell <i>et al.</i>
          Physical Review B (Rapid Communications) 97 121102(R) (2018)</a>]. <br><br>We have also used these model systems to illustrate that, unlike Kohn-Sham density functional theory, many-body
          perturbation theory methods such as Hartree-Fock and the GW approximation exhibit Kohn’s concept of nearsightedness [<a href="https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.99.045129">J. Wetherell <i>et al.</i> Physical Review B 99 045129 (2019)</a>]. This means that the potential describing one subsystem needs not contain any additional features due to the presence of surrounding subsystems. See the following video (first presented at the ETSF Young Researcher's Meeting 2019) for an in-depth discussion of this branch of research:

          <i>Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory</i><br>
	        One of the fundamental challenges of TDDFT is approximating the Kohn-Sham (KS) exchange-correlation (xc) potential. We have shown that LDAs (Local Density Approximations) to the xc potential can be constructed in finite systems from 'slab-like' systems of 1, 2 and 3 electrons [<a href="https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.94.205134">M. T. Entwistle <i>et al.</i> Physical Review B 94 205134 (2016)</a>]. We showed that these local approximations when applied adiabatically as the time-dependent exchange-correlation potential perform very poorly for the time-dependent density in a dynamic tunnelling system. We have learned from our work in MBPT that this is predominantly due to the lack of ‘nearsightedness’; an advantageous property that each electron is only effected by features of the fictitious potential in its own vicinity. Subsequently we construct a nearsighted form of generalised TD-KS theory based on unrestricted Hartree-Fock theory. [<a href="https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.101.032502">M. J. P. Hodgson and J. Wetherell. Physical Review A 101 032502 (2020)</a>]. We find simple approximations to our approach (we term our new approximation the ULDA+) give greatly improved electronic properties when applied to exactly-solvable model molecules, as they are required to capture far less complex physical phenomena. <img src="files/uhfks.png" alt="UHFKS" style="width:280px;border:5px solid white;float:right;"> The improvements this novel theory provides can be used to accelerate the rapid development of cutting-edge molecular technologies.

          <i>The Connector Approach</i><br>
          My research is primarily focused on systems of interacting electrons. The goal is to develop theories
          able to accurately predict the time-dependent properties and excitations of electrons in nanostructures, that can then be applied to systems such as
          molecular junctions, single molecules or atoms. Due to the extremely rapid miniaturization of semiconductor electronics, silicon based integrated circuits are
          reaching the limit of Moore’s law. Attempts to overcome this limitation has lead to the development of molecular electronics. In order to design the required molecular
          characteristics to serve in large-scale devices, an accurate and computationally tractable theoretical description of electron interaction in the presence of dynamic
          electric fields is needed.  The approach is to study model systems of several electrons that, using efficient computational techniques, can be solved exactly.
          This information is used to highlight, understand and quantify the failings of standard approximations, thus informing the development of improved novel methods.
          <br><br>
          In many areas of condensed matter research, it is crucial to accuracly determine the physical properties of many-particle quantum systems. In practice, solving such problems exactly is
          computationally intractable due to the complexity of such systems, and so approximations must be made. One method is to identify a class of model systems that can be solved exactly,
          and then import these results from the models to the real system. This is in principle a fundamentally approximate approach. The connector approach allow us to, under certain
          conditions, define a procedure of importing results that ensures the properties predicted for our system are exact. We are currently working on integrating this with our other
          new appraoches to develop a new class of methods for condenced matter physics.

          <i>Hybrid Functionals</i><br>
          Hybrid functionals are usually considered the meeting point between DFT (LDA or PBE etc) and MBPT (Hartree-Fock). By mixing these potentials together via a linear mixing parameter
          one can generate more accurate results than the individual methods alone. <img src="files/hybrid.png" alt="Hybrid E vs N" style="width:280px;border:5px solid white;solid white;float:right;">
          We explored the effect of determining the mixing parameter via enforcing Koopermans' condition to hold in
          our model systems. We show that this method yields strikingly accurate densities [<a href="https://journals.aps.org/prmaterials/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevMaterials.2.040801">A. R. Elmaslmane and
