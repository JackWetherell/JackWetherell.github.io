	The goal of the iDEA code is to improve the accuracy of approximations within fundamental theories of many-electron quantum mechanics. The iDEA code (interacting Dynamic Electrons Approach) is a Python software suite (with Cython extensions) developed in Rex Godby's group at the University of York since 2010. It has a central role in a number of research projects related to many-particle quantum mechanics for electrons in matter. <br><br>

	<b>iDEA's main features:</b>
	<ul>
 	<li>Exact solution of the many-electron (time-dependent) Schr√∂dinger equation, including exact exchange and correlation</li>
  	<li>Simplicity and exact solutions which approach the degree of exchange and correlation in realistic systems achieved using spinless electrons in one dimension</li>
  	<li>An arbitrary external potential that may be time-dependent</li>
 	<li>Optimisation methods to determine the exact (time-dependent) Kohn-Sham potential and energy components of (time-dependent) density functional theory</li>
  	<li>Implementation of various approximate functionals (established and novel) for comparison</li>
  	<li>Established and novel localisation measures</li>
  	<li>Many-body perturbation theory</li>
	</ul>
        <br>

	<b>The methodology:</b>
	Once more reliable approximations are devised, the next crucial step is for these new methods to be implemented into large-scale codes which model realistic systems in order to establish their accuracy. If these new methods prove to be improvements on existing methods, they 		can then be used to model a wider range of physical systems enhancing our knowledge of materials and chemicals. <br><br>
